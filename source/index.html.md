Visualize.js test
============

Visualize.js is a JavaScript API framework used to embed JasperReport Server reports & visualizations inside web applications.
It comes bundled with the commercial editions of TIBCO JasperReportsÂ® Server, specifically Jaspersoft AWS, Enterprise or
Professional (and as an add-on with Jaspersoft Reporting).

Try it:

<b>[Render table], [customize with CSS], [crosstab with CSS], [chart with selector]</b>

Initialization of the visualize.js library with simple rendering of ad hoc views using plain text authentication. See full authentication samples in this guide for securing data and views with the JasperReports Server and Visualize.js.

>You can easily change the resource to embed a different view from the JasperReport Server.

>For example:

``` javascript
        resource: "/public/viz/Adhoc/Change_Visualization2"
``` 

Try it:

<b>[Load multiple views]</b>

Use a common configuration to load multiple views.

### Control Canvas

Try it:

<b>[Set canvas type]</b>, <b>[dynamically from a list]</b>

Control the ad hoc view visualization type (canvas) for users to access. The default visualization selector can be turned off with a line of CSS and only select visualizations used. See dynamic list example for all available visualizations and each name reference.

### Input Controls

Try it:

<b>[Paramater passing]</b>, <b>[basic drop-down]</b>

Pass a simple set of hard-coded parameters to control ad hoc view output. This can be expanded with custom inputs controls such as a drop-down.

Try it:

<b>[Dynamic input control values]</b>

Build a custom input control dynamically using input control data from an ad hoc view.

>Try: A hard coded or dynamic variable...

``` javascript
      inputSelection = "Non-Consumable"

>for parameter control...

``` javascript
      "ProductFamily": ["Food", inputSelection]
``` 

### Hyperlinks

Try it:

<b>[Pass values]</b>, <b>[fields and measures]</b>

On selection of a data point pass it's value or field and measure.

Try it:

<b>[Drill down on selection]</b>, <b>[in new view]</b>

Select an ad hoc view data point to drill down into data within the same view (container) based on the selected field and measure, updating the visualization type. Pass the same values to render a new ad hoc view on the page.

Try it:

<b>[Hyperlink changes beforeRender]</b>

Take action on hyperlinks before they render. Useful for changing the styles on hyperlinks.

### Custom Visualization

Try it:

<b>[Data rendered on page]</b>, <b>[with D3 gauges]</b>

Render just the Ad Hoc View data on the page or pass to a custom visualization library such as D3.

Try it:

<b>[Loading of data]</b>, <b>[through return values]</b>

Navigate the internal data API and return values to update and return the number of columns and rows.

### UI Controls

Try it:

<b>[Table row selection]</b>, <b>[column selection with highlight]</b>

Select all values on a table row/column using CSS styles to highlight.

Try it:

<b>[Resize Ad Hoc View]</b>

Ad hoc views are web responsive and the container size can be changed as needed.

### Authentication

Try it:

<b>[Refresh]</b>, <b>[destroy session]</b>

Hooks for both refreshing and destroying the authentication for an ad hoc view.

Try it:

<b>[Secure token authentication]</b>

Token based authentication and initialization of the visualize.js library with a list of ad hoc views.
